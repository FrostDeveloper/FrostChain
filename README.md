#Official FrostChain development/staging tree
=============================================================

###What is the FrostChain?

FrostChain is an advanced sidechain solution that works parallel to the Frost blockchain. The command-line client
enables users to generate their own lightweight sidechain, with a double-layered security protocol that locks block
information through the network propagation of the Frost blockchain as well as with a general consensus amongst all
running sidechain clients. This tamper proof combination protects the integrity of individual sidechain applications
by combining the security features of both blockchains into one.

FrostChain is currently closed source. There are currently no plans on releasing current development progress into
the public. The Frost project started on July 10, 2016.
